# odin-recipes
This project is an HTML project, no CSS or Javascript. 
I will be creating a Recipe webpage. Although this is not my first time doing something like this or even writing code, I am sticking to the Odin Projects course outline and not skipping ahead. I'm finding this important to learn properly because there are times when things are missed. I am still very new to using Git commands and at this current point I find this more of the learning objective then the HTML in this section.
